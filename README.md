# Climate-Change--Machoi-Glacier-Loss
Impact of global warming and broader climate change on Machoi Glacier, which has lost almost 50% of its cover in 4 decades.
The glacier is the source of the Sind River that flows westwards, and the Dras river that flows eastwards.

Machoi, like many other Himalayan glaciers has been melting at alarming rates due to Global warming.
