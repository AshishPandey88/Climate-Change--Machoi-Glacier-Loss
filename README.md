# Climate-Change--Machoi-Glacier-Loss
Impact of global warming and broader climate change on Machoi Glacier, which has lost almost 50% of its cover in 4 decades.
The glacier is the source of the Sind River that flows westwards, and the Dras river that flows eastwards.

Machoi, like many other Himalayan glaciers has been melting at alarming rates due to Global warming.

📉Shrinking of Indian glaciers 😰- Machoi Glacier

Climate change 🌡️- Machoi Glacier ⛰️ has lost almost 50% of its ice cover in the last 4 decades!!!

🏞️ The glacier is the source of the Sind River 🌊 that flows westwards, and the Dras river 🌊 that flows eastwards

This is my second post on the series "Shrinking Indian Glaciers", trying to quantify the glacier cover loss using Image segmentation on Satellite images.

As an Individual I know global warming is real and is impacting our climate system, but seeing the rapidly increasing numbers of loss in glacier cover over Himalyan region is scary ☠️, and is a matter of concern 😱.

These glaciers are key source of important perennial rivers on which the population of India survives.
